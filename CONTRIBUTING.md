## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Familiarity with terminal/console applications
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Git for version control

### Project Overview

The Recipe Management System is a terminal-based application that allows users to manage personal recipe collections. It features:

- User authentication and management
- Recipe creation, editing, and organization
- Search and categorization capabilities
- Data export/import functionality
- Statistics and analytics

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-management-system.git
   cd recipe-management-system
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Run the application to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

No additional dependencies are required beyond Python's standard library.

- Menu and form handling
- Console output formatting

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug Reports**: Report issues using the issue tracker
2. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
3. **Code Contributions**: Implement new features or fix bugs
4. **Documentation**: Improve documentation and examples
5. **Testing**: Add test cases or improve existing tests

### Finding Issues to Work On

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) for open issues
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
3. Comment on issues to indicate you're working on them
4. If you want to work on something not listed, create a new issue first

### Development Workflow

1. **Create an Issue**: For significant changes, create an issue to discuss before implementing
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Develop**: Write code following the coding standards
4. **Test**: Ensure your changes work as expected
5. **Commit**: Write clear, concise commit messages
6. **Push**: Push to your fork
7. **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public methods and classes
- Keep lines under 88 characters (recommended)

### Code Organization

1. **Imports**: 
   - Group imports in standard order (stdlib, third-party, local)
   - Use absolute imports when possible
   - Avoid wildcard imports

2. **Functions**:
   - Keep functions focused and small
   - Use type hints where appropriate
   - Include docstrings for public functions

3. **Classes**:
   - Use descriptive class names (PascalCase)
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Document public methods

### Documentation

- Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- Maintain docstrings for all public methods
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Include usage examples where appropriate

### Testing

While formal unit tests aren't currently implemented, contributors should:

1. **Manual Testing**: Thoroughly test changes before submitting
2. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases and error conditions
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Cross-Platform**: Test on different operating systems if possible

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Branch**: Work on your own fork in a feature branch
2. **Quality Check**:
   - Ensure code follows the style guide
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Remove any debugging code

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commit format when possible
   - Keep commits focused on single changes

4. **Pull Request**:
   - Base your PR on the `main` branch
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include steps for testing/reproducing

5. **Review Process**:
   - Respond promptly to feedback
   - Make requested changes
   - Be open to suggestions
   - Maintain a collaborative attitude
